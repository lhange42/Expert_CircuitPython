## CircuitPython to Processing

### Description
This Assignment involved sending CircuitPython potentiometer readings to Processing.

### Lessons Learned
This was my first time ever using a UART and took me a while to understand its function. The UART contaionsI had become soomewhat familiar with Processing because of the first assignment. We learned some new coding commands mostly involved with circular motion. We created a spedometer that correlated to the potentiometer's movement. I also had to use sin and cos when finding and setting the angle of the line.

## Processing to Circuitpython

### Description
In this assignment we used Proscessing to create a mouse tracker that controled servo's depending on the mouse's location

### Lessons Learned
This assignment was very difficult and took a lot of research and hardwork to try to find a solution. i learned the importance of syncing up delays when you are transferring and replacing strings we would get errors like must be in base 10. Our code would of worked if we had simply synced up the delays but it took us a while to do that. I also learned more about string replacing. In order to correlate them we had to map it so I learned how to map in Proscessing which wasn't hard siince it was very similar.
