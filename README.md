## CircuitPython to Processing

### Description
This Assignment involved sending CircuitPython potentiometer readings to Processing.

### Lessons Learned
This was my first time ever using a UART and took me a while to understand its function. The UART contaionsI had become soomewhat familiar with Processing because of the first assignment. We learned some new coding commands mostly involved with circular motion. We created a spedometer that correlated to the potentiometer's movement. In order to correlate them we had to map it so I learned how to map in Proscessing which wasn't hard siince it was very similar.
